== Description ==

The Board lets you create and easily manage an administration board for your structure. You can add members, fill out their basic informations, contacts informations, job title and place in hierarchy. You can also create working groups and subgroups to categorize members and display them in order.

To display just one member, copy the shortcode on the member creation/edit page and paste it in a new page.
To display a whole group or subgroup, go to the "groups" pannel, copy the shortcode corresponding to the group you wish to display and paste in a new page.
Finally, if you want to show all of your groups and subgroups in order, just put `[theboard display=all]` in a new page.

The Board comes with a default template that integrates well with the Twentyfourteen theme. However, you can override it totally or partially by adding `member.php`, `groups.php`, `css/styles.css`, `js/scripts.js` files in a directory named `plugins/the-board` at your root of your theme.

We integrated [Contact Form 7](http://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/) to The Board so you can easily let your users get in touch with your members. You absolutely can chose not to use it, everything will outputs just fine. Still, we recommend it :)

The basic structure of this plugin was cloned from the [WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate](https://github.com/tommcfarlin/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate) project.
